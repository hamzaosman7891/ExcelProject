This project identifies the relationship between scooter ownership amongst certain demographics(age group, income, marital status, education etc.) in various regions of the world.

The steps undertaken from the beginning to the end of the project are listed below;

# Data Cleaning 
In this process, I removed any duplicate records within the dataset. Ensured there were no spelling errors.
Created age groups through Nested IF statements 

# Data Exploration & Visualisation 

Through the use of Pivot Tables, three charts were created to help obtain insights from the data.

The first table indicates the average income of each group that purchases a scooter and those that did not. 
As you can discern, the age group, ‘Adults’ have the highest average income, which suggests that higher income earners are more likely able to afford to purchase a scooter.
Also, it's likely that the adults also purchased scooters for some of the younger adolescents. 
The statistics shown in the chart on the dashboard illustrate the correlation between income and purchasing a bike 

The second table illustrates how the distance of commute to work impacts the customer's decision to purchase a scooter.
The insight that can be gleaned from this chart is that the shorter the commute distance the more likely the person owns a scooter

The final pivot table shows how many scooters were purchased or not within each age bracket.
