This project identifies the total coffee sales over a period of four years split by the coffee type. There are four different types of coffee; Arabica, Liberica, Excelsa and Robusta. The dashboard contains the top customers and the sales by country as the coffee in this dataset is only being sold in US, UK and Ireland. 

# Data Gathering & Cleaning 

The dataset contained three tabs, each detailing information on customers and their respective orders. The orders tab had several unpopulated columns which needed to be filled.
The data was gathered through XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, Multiplication formulas and Multiple IF functions.
The data was cleaned by date formatting, number formatting and checking for duplicated records and spelling errors.  

# Data Exploration and Visualisation

The data spans the sales period from 2019–2022. To accurately represent this timeframe, I employed the timeline and slicer capabilities of pivot tables. A timeline is a fantastic tool that displays activities for chosen periods, aiding in structuring and summarizing the analysis.

I integrated slicers for essential components in my table to display the number of customers with and without loyalty cards, the sales distribution by coffee roast types, and the various coffee sizes sold. These slicers, in conjunction with the timeline, enable stakeholders to view specific segments of events on my dashboard, rendering it both dynamic and interactive.

This project identifies the relationship between scooter ownership amongst certain demographics(age group, income, marital status, education etc.) in various regions of the world.

The steps undertaken from the beginning to the end of the project are listed below;

# Data Cleaning 
In this process, I removed any duplicate records within the dataset. Ensured there were no spelling errors and created age groups through Nested IF statements. 

# Data Exploration & Visualisation 

Through the use of Pivot Tables, three charts were created to help obtain insights from the data.

The first table indicates the average income of each group that purchases a scooter and those that did not. 
As you can discern, the age group, ‘Adults’ have the highest average income, which suggests that higher income earners are more likely able to afford to purchase a scooter.
Also, it's likely that the adults also purchased scooters for some of the younger adolescents. 
The statistics shown in the chart on the dashboard illustrate the correlation between income and purchasing a scooter. 

The second table illustrates how the distance of commute to work impacts the customer's decision to purchase a scooter.
The insight that can be gleaned from this chart is that the shorter the commute distance the more likely the person owns a scooter

The final pivot table shows how many scooters were purchased or not within each age bracket.

I integrated slicers for essential components in my table to display the number of customers who are married or single, the occupation and education of the customers and which continent the customers are from.
